This course provides a deeper knowledge in two important fields of scientific computing:
1. molecular dynamics simulations
    - particle-based modelling (n-body simulation)
    - algorithms for efficient force calculation
    - parallelisation 

2. iterative solution of large sparse systems of linear equations:
    - relaxation methods
    - multigrid methods
    - steepest descent
    - conjugate gradient methods
    - preconditioning 

The course is conceived for students in computer science, mathematics, or some field of science or engineering who already have a certain background in the numerical treatment of (partial) differential equations.
