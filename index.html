<div>
I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Technical University of Munich. I research at the interface of three main areas: 
Application science (mechanical engineering, astrophysics and seismology), numerical methods development (fast solvers, high performance computing)
and uncertainty quantification (multifidelity methods).
